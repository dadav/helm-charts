# Install Container Security Operator

This chart will install Quay Container Security Operator. It is just the deployment of the Operator, which does not have any CRDs or further configuration. 
The following Subcharts are used as dependency:

* [helper-operator](https://github.com/tjungbauer/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/helper-operator): to create the required Operator resources
* [helper-status-checker](https://github.com/tjungbauer/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/helper-operator): to verify if the Deployments of this Operator are running. 

The whole process has multiple hooks and waves, which are illustrated in the image: 

![GitOps Flow](docs/img/RHACS-Deployment-Waves.png)

It is best used with a GitOps approach such as Argo CD does. For example, https://github.com/tjungbauer/openshift-cluster-bootstrap
